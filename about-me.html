    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>I'm Christian &#128075
    <p>
      I love Philosophy, the Great Outdoors, and ofcourse Tech. 
      I graduated from Lee University in 2019 with a B.S in Communications, and a passion for positively affecting the people I interact with. 
      As one of my friends once said: I not interested in "making an appearance" -- I want to make a difference.
      I enjoy living with my Wife (À la stage right) and our two amazing dogs, Titus and Huxley. 
      I'm a lover, not a fighter; with my own american pastime of binging terrible T.V Shows. 
      My wife and I are “How I Met Your Mother” fans, not “The Office” fans, and we really enjoy making new friends and sharing new experiences together. 
    </p>

    <p>“Whatever you do in this life, it’s not legendary unless your friends are there to see it”! – Barney Stinson</p>

    <p>
      I've had the gift of gab since the cradle. With my Dad from Chicago, and my Mother from Queens, I could make best freinds with a brickwall, if needed. 
      Afffectionalty, according to my Mother, once I said my first words, I never shutup. 
      With being able to talk about anything, my mind naturally gravitated to the more complex areas of life. 
      With over 5 years of experience in the tech field, even more so in communications, Big Tech and SaSS were always a draw for me. 
      Currently I am a Solution Engineer at PriceSpider with experience in designing, implementing, and managing technical solutions for clients. 
      I am proficient in various programming languages, as listed below, and experienced in working with data aggregation technologies. 
      I possess excellent problem-solving skills and a strong ability to translate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. 
      I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions that meets the clients needs. And ofcourse, I all about that data.
